To be able to submit job you need to run 3 core subsystems on each host by calling:

1. `start-env`
2. `start-peer-group`
3. `start-peers`

Each of those subsystems has shutdown counterpart method:

* `shutdown-env`
* `shutdown-peer-group`
* `shutdown-peers`

When whole core is running then you can submit job from any of hosts.
Rest of hosts will pick up job via Zookeeper.

4. `submit-job`

You can kill job by calling.

* `kill-job(cfg, job-id)`
