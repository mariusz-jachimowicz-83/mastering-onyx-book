Main interactions with onyx cluster:

* `kill-job` - kill running job.
* `gc` - force to shrink replica. Useable for bigger clusters or when you have many short jobs.
* `await-job-completion` - wait until job completes. Usefull for tests.
* `subscribe-to-log` - it allows to create replica. Zookeeper is used as an appendable log and whole cluster is using masterless synchronization. If you want know a cluster state then you need to subscribe to log and create local replica from it.
